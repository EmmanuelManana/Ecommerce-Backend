# E Commerce Backend
A database application to track your employees

Bootcamp Challenge 13: ORM

Description


This application was developed to empower internet retail businesses in maintaining an updated MySQL database that records specific categories, products, and tags pertinent to their e-commerce operations, encompassing sales and inventory management. Leveraging Sequelize as an ORM (object-relational-mapping) facilitates interaction with the MySQL database, enhancing code readability, reusability, and overall project organization. By employing Sequelize, the project benefits from the decomposition of larger files into more manageable components, promoting code isolation, reducing redundancy (keeping the code DRY), and ensuring maintainability for future development.

This undertaking represents the initial phase of a sophisticated backend application, accessible through tools like Insomnia. Using Insomnia, users can systematically test the functionality of API routes embedded in the application code. This empowers them to effortlessly inspect existing data, introduce new data, update information, and delete records from the databaseâ€” all without the need for a graphical user interface.
